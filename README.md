# zkML-DvPGiza
A ZK ML Based DvP - Delivery versus Payment Engine in GIZA for Real world capabilities


##Problem Statement
There is a huge need in Enterprise systems(Web2) for trust collaboration. Blockchains can help in many aspects of provenance, immutabiltiy , but yet the adoption has not crossed beyond crypto-native and payments centered use-cases. While enterprises have spent a lot of time and energy on ML systems, they are typically single entity centered optimization that does not extend beyond that entity, and hence there is a huge void and an opportunity to bring web2 and web 3 systems together in many areas of trust need minimization and  collaborative AL/ ML.

##Solution

ZK ML coud potentially fill in the gap, where the collaborative flows can be enabled 

zkML-DvP, focuses in the following areas. 

1. Increasing trustworthiness of models, but for public explanation / consumption of services,
2. Increasing transparency of processes intended to be transparent but not yet there.
3. While, preserving privacy where needed in
4. regulatory compliance, in areas such as health, and Insurance
5. and reducing redundant "trust but re-do to verify"- where many business process B2B overheads can be reduced and passed on to consumers.
Specifically, Reducing the Re-verification proecesses and cost is a key part of Zk-DvP, from ChainAim.

The firnst MVP Iteration 1 implementation of ZK DvP, is on GIZA, with transactions posting to ETH Sepolia, and ZKSync, and STARKNET, 
for specific flavors of zkml-DvP in insurance ( US Healthcare), Alternative Payments ( US Healthcare).

## Background in Insurance, Healthcare, Trade finance , Payments B2B and B2B2C processes

#What's next

Further iterations will add Supply chain and Trade EXIM areas of collaborative corrabotation.

#HOW TO RUN zK-DvP application(testnet)

  Follow the steps to install GIZA the models, endpoints and agents
  Start the application by running start-streamlit 
  Interact with the application opening up in the Browser. Check the transactions in the blockchain Explorers.

Sincere thanks to Giza/Encode teams and fellow hackers.
